- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
It is interesting how I can make multiple classes connect to each other. Somtimes it is interesting to see how the classes interact with different placements of other classes in a certain class, for example putting a class in the methods of another class will obviously make the second class dependent on the first one, therefore making composition relationship between the second class and the first class. It is just very interesting to identify the individual relationship present in the code base. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
definitely consult a friend when you are stuck, because there are just some times in which life would not cooporate with you and having a friend by your side and helping out your difficulties would definitely help out a lot.
